# Breast Cancer prediction

### Introduction

This project uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning (LSTM) to detect breast cancer from medical data. The model classifies tumors as cancerous or non-cancerous.

### Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and includes multiple medical features. The diagnosis column is encoded into numerical values for model training.

### Methodology

* Data preprocessing and label encoding
* Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)
* LSTM-based neural network model
* Model training using binary cross-entropy loss

### Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using:

* Accuracy score
* Confusion matrix
* Loss and accuracy graphs
